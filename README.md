Data source:  https://www.kaggle.com/anikannal/solar-power-generation-data. 

The data source provides two set of files contaning the details of Solar power generation at two plants.Also ,the sensor values at each plant is contained in two seperate sensor data files.  

The Analysis objective is to understand:  
a. power generation at the solar plant - how much power is generated and when ??  
b. any untypical behaviour of the equipments at the plant such as the inverter panels. 
c. what factors influence the generation of the solar power ??  
d. whether we can predict the solar power generated for the future dates? if yes, with what accuracy ?
